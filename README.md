# Simple Blog app

This is an app that helps us to read blogs about a topic. Here we can read only travel blogs that have been uploaded [here](https://bitbucket.org/dmytrodanylyk/travel-blog-resources/src/master/). The blogs can be sorted by date and also in alphabetical order.<br>

This app is actually a part of an [Educative](https://www.educative.io/) course. The course can be found [here](https://www.educative.io/courses/modern-android-app-development). Feel free to check it out. <br>

In order to run the app perform the following steps.
1. download simple blog.apk
2. install it
3. use _admin_ for both username and password
4. go through the travel blogs, feel free to sort them in alphabetical order or by date.

## Possible improvements-
1. it currently supports only travel blogs, but it can made to support various types of blogs
2. the current app only takes _admin_ as username and password, the number of users that can be supported should be >1
3. the app looks very basic, it should be made colorful
